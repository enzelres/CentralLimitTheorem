# CentralLimitTheorem
Project for PHYS-3201

In this project we visualize the central limit theorem by sampling from different distributions and observe how the distribution of their samples mean evolve with increasinhg sample size.

To change the Distribution type you can change the distribution = "uniform" to
distribution = "exponential" for an exponential distribution
and distribution = "binomial" for a binomial distribution.
