# Central Limit Theorem Visualization
Project for PHYS-3201

In this project, we visualize the central limit theorem by sampling from different distributions and observing how the distribution of their sample mean evolves with increasing sample size.

To change the Distribution type you can change the distribution = "uniform" to
distribution = "exponential" for an exponential distribution
and distribution = "binomial" for a binomial distribution

Required Python Packages:

NumPy, 
matplotlib
